
## Crop Yield and Production Analysis

This repository contains code for analyzing crop yield and production data from the years 2006-2011. The analysis includes visualizations of production, area, and yield for each crop over the specified years, as well as predictions for future production using linear regression models.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you will need to have Python installed, along with the following libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- pickle

## You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

```bash
cd your-repo-name
```

3. Run the analysis script:

```bash
python analysis.py
```

## Data

The dataset used in this analysis is assumed to be in the file `datafile.csv`. The columns of the dataset include crop names, production, area, and yield for the years 2006-2011.

## Visualization

The code generates visualizations for each crop, showing the production, area, and yield for each year from 2006 to 2011. Here are some example visualizations:

- Line plots for production, area, and yield for each year
- Bar plots for production with line plots for area and yield

## Prediction

The code also includes a predictive model for estimating future crop production based on historical data. A linear regression model is trained for each crop, and the trained models are saved to disk. You can use these models to predict future production for a specific crop and year.

Example usage:

```python
# Load the models from disk
with open('crop_models.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    crop_models = pickle.load(f)

# Predict production for a specific crop and year
predicted_production = predict_production('Rice', 2026)
print(f'Predicted Production for Rice in 2026: {predicted_production}')
```
